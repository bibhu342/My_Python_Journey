# 🐍 My Python Journey

Welcome to my **30-day Python Sprint** — a structured journey to master Python fundamentals, build real mini-projects, and create a strong foundation for my **AI Engineer roadmap** 🚀

This repo is my **public daily learning log** — where I push code, structured notes, and projects every day to build consistency and momentum toward my goal of becoming an **AI Engineer at Google** by 2026.
