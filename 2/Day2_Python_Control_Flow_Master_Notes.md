# 🐍 Python Day 2 — Control Flow (If / Elif / Else) (Master Notes)

**Core Objective:**  
Learn how Python makes decisions, branch execution paths, and evaluate conditions cleanly.

---

## Step 1 — if Statement

📜 **Problem Statement**  
Execute a block only if a certain condition is met.

🧮 **Example**
```python
score = 85
if score > 50:
    print("You passed!")
```

🧠 **Why This Matters**
- Decision-making is at the heart of almost all programs.  
- Everything from authentication, billing logic, to AI models depends on it.

🧰 **Breakdown**
- Condition must evaluate to True or False.  
- Indentation defines the scope of the if block.

🌍 **Real-World Use Cases**
- Basic validation  
- Condition checks in API endpoints  
- Simple access control logic

---

## Step 2 — if-else Statement

📜 **Problem Statement**  
Handle two mutually exclusive outcomes (either do A or B).

🧮 **Example**
```python
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult.")
else:
    print("You are a minor.")
```

🧠 **Why This Matters**
- Foundation for binary decisions in software: yes/no, pass/fail, success/error.

🌍 **Real-World Use Cases**
- Eligibility checks (e.g., KYC, login)  
- Conditional user experiences  
- Workflow routing in backend systems

---

## Step 3 — if-elif-else Ladder

📜 **Problem Statement**  
Handle multiple branching paths cleanly.

🧮 **Example**
```python
score = int(input("Enter score: "))
if score >= 90:
    print("Grade: A")
elif score >= 75:
    print("Grade: B")
elif score >= 60:
    print("Grade: C")
elif score >= 40:
    print("Grade: D")
else:
    print("Grade: F")
```

🧠 **Why This Matters**
- Real logic isn’t just yes/no — it’s often multi-level.  
- Keeps code clean vs nested if-else blocks.

🌍 **Real-World Use Cases**
- Tier classification (grades, pricing, performance bands)  
- Access rules by user type  
- Routing different processes in automation

---

## Step 4 — Logical Operators (and, or, not)

📜 **Problem Statement**  
Combine multiple conditions for more complex logic.

🧮 **Example**
```python
score = 85
attendance = 90
if score >= 75 and attendance >= 80:
    print("You qualify for scholarship.")
```

🧠 **Why This Matters**
- Real-world checks are rarely one-dimensional.  
- AND/OR/NOT allow for complex, readable conditions.

🌍 **Real-World Use Cases**
- Form validation  
- Access control with multiple parameters  
- Fraud detection rules

---

## Step 5 — Nested Conditions

📜 **Problem Statement**  
Make decisions inside other decisions.

🧮 **Example**
```python
score = 85
attendance = 70
if score >= 75:
    if attendance >= 80:
        print("Excellent performance.")
    else:
        print("Good marks, but low attendance.")
else:
    print("Improve your score.")
```

🧠 **Why This Matters**
- Some business rules depend on hierarchical conditions.  
- But — too much nesting can make code messy.

🌍 **Real-World Use Cases**
- Workflow approvals with dependencies  
- AI decision trees  
- Complex policy or rule engines

---

## Step 6 — Input Validation with if

📜 **Problem Statement**  
Validate user inputs before using them (to prevent crashes or wrong results).

🧮 **Example**
```python
score = int(input("Enter score (0-100): "))
if score < 0 or score > 100:
    print("Invalid input")
else:
    print("Score accepted")
```

🧠 **Why This Matters**
- Validation is critical in every system.  
- Prevents user errors, system crashes, or bad data.

🌍 **Real-World Use Cases**
- API input validation  
- CLI tools with guarded input  
- Data processing pipelines

---

## Step 7 — Real Project Example: Grading Engine

📜 **Problem Statement**  
Create a small system that:
- Takes score, attendance, cheating flag.  
- Disqualifies cheaters.  
- Downgrades grade if attendance < 75%.  
- Gives grace for near-miss cases.

🧮 **Example**
```python
score = int(input("Score: "))
attendance = int(input("Attendance %: "))
cheated = input("Cheated? (Y/N): ").upper()

if cheated == "Y":
    print("Disqualified!")
elif score >= 90:
    grade = "A"
elif score >= 75:
    grade = "B"
elif score >= 60:
    grade = "C"
elif score >= 40:
    grade = "D"
else:
    grade = "F"

# Grace for near misses
if grade == "F" and 38 <= score <= 39 and attendance >= 90:
    grade = "D"

# Attendance downgrade
if attendance < 75 and grade != "F":
    downgrade = {"A":"B","B":"C","C":"D","D":"F"}
    grade = downgrade[grade]

print(f"Final Grade: {grade}")
```

🌍 **Real-World Use Cases**
- Scoring engines in edtech platforms  
- Tier assignment logic in business rules  
- Conditional workflows in AI pipelines
